# Number Guessing Game

## Introduction
The Number Guessing Game is a simple, console-based C# application where players attempt to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 10. The game offers players five attempts to guess the correct number, with feedback provided for each guess.

## Requirements
- .NET Core 8.0 SDK or later
- A compatible IDE (Visual Studio, VS Code, or JetBrains Rider)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/steerpike100/NumberGame.git



Navigate to the cloned directory.
Open the solution file (NumberGuessGame.sln) with your IDE.
Build the solution to resolve dependencies.

How to Play
Run the application from your IDE or navigate to the output directory and run the executable from the command line.
Press ENTER to start the game when prompted.
Enter your guess for the random number between 1 and 10 and press ENTER.
You will receive feedback on whether your guess was too high, too low, or correct.
If you guess incorrectly, you will be prompted to guess again until you either guess correctly or exhaust your five attempts.
After the game concludes (either by guessing correctly or running out of attempts), you will be asked if you would like to play again. Respond with y for yes or n for no.
